# metaGOTHIC UI Components Environment Configuration

# GitHub API Configuration
# GitHub operations are now handled through the GraphQL federation gateway.
# The token is still needed for authentication:
# 1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with the following scopes:
#    - repo (for repository access)
#    - workflow (for triggering/managing workflows)
#    - read:packages (for package information)
#    - read:org (for organization access)
# 2. Copy this file to .env.local and add your token:
VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

# GraphQL Federation Gateway Configuration
# All API requests go through the federated GraphQL gateway
# The gateway runs on port 3000 and federates all services
VITE_GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:3000/graphql
VITE_GATEWAY_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3000/graphql

# Legacy endpoints (removed - all operations use GraphQL federation)
# The following services are federated through the gateway:
# - Claude Service (port 3002)
# - Repo Agent Service (port 3004)
# - GitHub Service (port 3005)

# Development settings
VITE_DEV_MODE=true
VITE_LOG_LEVEL=info

# Federation Architecture
# The UI connects only to the federation gateway at port 3000
# The gateway automatically routes queries to the appropriate services:
# - Claude operations → Claude Service (3002)
# - Git operations → Repo Agent Service (3004)
# - GitHub operations → GitHub Mesh Service (3005)
