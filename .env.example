# metaGOTHIC UI Components Environment Configuration

# GitHub API Configuration
# GitHub operations are now handled through the GraphQL federation gateway.
# The token is still needed for authentication:
# 1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with the following scopes:
#    - repo (for repository access)
#    - workflow (for triggering/managing workflows)
#    - read:packages (for package information)
#    - read:org (for organization access)
# 2. Copy this file to .env.local and add your token:
VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

# GraphQL Federation Gateway Configuration
# All API requests go through the GraphQL gateway (no direct REST calls)
VITE_GRAPHQL_URL=http://localhost:3001/graphql
